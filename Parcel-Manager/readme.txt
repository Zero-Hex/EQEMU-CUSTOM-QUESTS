The Parcel System allows players to view and retrieve their parcels from anywhere in the world. This plugin goes great with the Auction System as a companion to it.

Players use the command !parcel to display a list of their parcels waiting to be picked up. They can click reclaim on an item to have it placed on their cursor instantly. Or they can use the reclaim all option to place all parcels on their cursor.

This system also handles money as well with no issues.
