Auction Master Plugin System

The auction master allows for GMs to set up special auctions that players can bid on using an alternate currency of your choice. A GM sets up the auction, how much the initial bid is and optionally how much they want each increase to be.

Once an auction is complete the item is parceled to the Winner. As the auction progresses and people become outbid the system automatically sends them their alternate currency back via parcel as well.

Players can optionally access the system via an Auction_Master NPC or with the command !auction from anywhere in Norrath or beyond. 

This features a soft close where if a bid comes in during the last 90 seconds the timer will automatically extend by 1 minute to allow for more bids. This prevents someone from bidding at the last second and winning the item.
