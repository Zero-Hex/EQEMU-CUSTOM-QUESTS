The Buff Bag system allows players to place items into a buff bag and use the command !buff to instantly apply these buffs to their characters as long as they meet the requirements.

- No Detrimental Spells
- No instant duration spells
- You must be able to click the item
- No buffs that have a cooldown (toggleable)

By default the cast time on the items is ignored, but can be toggled in the system.

The bag can be placed in any bank slot (not shared) or in the inventory and the command will work from anywhere.
